      <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi there, my name is William (or Will for short), but most people know me by the nickname I thought was my real
        name until kindergarten, BJ (short for Billy-Josiah). I've always had a passion for technology of some kind.
        What exactly that was has evolved throughout my life, but the overall concept of technology has always stayed
        the same. Starting in middle school, I became very interested in spaceflight and aerospace engineering. During
        my 7th grade year, I also became interested in programming, more specifically the Python programming language. I
        started with the basics, text based games and simple scripts. At that point that's really all it was. However,
        in the summer between my Freshman and Sophomore years, I took some programming courses online, and started to
        learn much more advanced concepts. I learned how to use classes and objects, and in general more advanced
        concepts that assist in making code both cleaner and giving your programs more complex and advanced behavior.
        Over that summer I sharpened my skills with Python, and also picked up C, C++, C#, and PHP. Then, starting in my
        Sophomore year, I realized that this was really what I want to do with my life. I worked on several projects
        with Raspberry Pi, using a concept of Python, C++, and PHP (and with PHP of course comes HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript). I created an access control system for the school, which I named Passage. It worked off of
        Raspberry Pi, and used a homegrown web interface and NFC (Near Field Communication) cards to allow students and
        staff to travel between buildings much more efficiently. I also built several other Raspberry Pi and Arduino
        projects, but to this day Passage is my proudest accomplishment. In the summer between Sophomore and Junior
        year, I took an online machine learning course, and that really opened my eyes to so many new possibilities. The
        course was tough, but I ended up completing it and earning the certificate. I loved machine learning, I was
        fascinated with it. I devoted a lot of time both in and out of school on learning more. I wanted to soak up all
        the knowledge I could. I started incorporating it into a lot of my projects, and I really enjoyed it. I really
        have a passion for machine learning, and I love to see all the amazing things it is capable of. My dream is to
        work with machine learning at Tesla. To this day I continue to innovate, and learn more advanced techniques,
        with the goal of my work eventually being used to power the self driving cars of the future.
        </br></br>
        <b>TL;DR: I love computers, more specifically machine learning.</b>

                  This was one of my first big projects I did at NWPHS. I used a game called Kerbal Space Program to
                  recreate many historic US space programs, as well as some current and future programs. I started with
                  the small steps taken with project Mercury, then moved all the way up to the
                  Apollo program where we brought man to the moon (or in KSP the mun). I also focused on some programs
                  that are currently in planning or early testing stages such as the SpaceX Dragon and Boeing's
                  CST-100. This project was my first long project, and there were many points where I wanted to give up
                  on it, however I kept going, and it taught me how to keep going even when you don't want to or you
                  don't think you can. In the end however I compiled all of it into a website and detailed all of my
                  missions and the craft development process.
                  I also covered some of the key physics principles that allowed these vehicles to fly. You can view the

                  This was the first workshop that I participated in. The purpose of the workshop was to design and
                  build stands for some beehives that had been acquired by a local organization.
                  They needed these stands so that they could keep the hive boxes safe from the elements as well as from
                  other animals in the wild. Over the course of the workshop we started with a discussion about how the
                  hives themselves worked, and how other stands were designed. We then moved onto our design stage,
                  where we had to come up with three different designs. After we had out initial designs we met with the
                  person from the organization, where he provided some feedback and selected the design to proceed to
                  the prototype stage with. Once in the prototype stage we fleshed everything out and got out material
                  lists together. Finally, the last step was to build them. This was the first time I had worked with a lot of different shop equipment. It was challenging at first but I was able to adapt quickly and
                  produce a final product. After we build out design the final step was applying weatherproof paint.
                  Once that was done they were sent off to make a difference.

                  This project is a good example to how much a project can evolve from initial plan to final product.
                  The original idea with this project was to create a model of a rocket engine to show all the internal
                  components that make it run. I planned to design and 3d print most of the components, and use
                  something similar to a Coke and Mentos reaction to model how the engine produces thrust. However,
                  during the course of the project my 3d printer stopped working and was unable to produce prints of the
                  quality that I would require. That's when the goal shifted. I was able to compromise and create some
                  3d animations instead. I used Autodesk Maya to create and render some animations. It was difficult as
                  I still hadn't really gotten the hang of effective 3d models. Of all the animations I think I'm most
                  proud of the turbo pump one because it was the first time I worked with fluids in Maya. Once all the
                  animations were rendered I put them into a Google Site and combined them with some explanations I
                  wrote for some of the physics that go into a rocket engine. Overall this project is a great example of
                  a very vital idea in project based learning: you can't always build what you originally intend to,
                  oftentimes you'll have to compromise and optimize the project to get done in a timely manner but still
                  produce a good final product. The final product is available <a href="https://sites.google.com/nwphs.org/liquid-fuel-engines/home">here.</a>

                In terms of my high school career, this is where I transitioned from a focus of aerospace engineering to programming.
                The idea actually came about when I was curious how Apple Pay worked. Once I learned about the technology, I wanted to try
                it for myself. I came up with the idea of a cheap, easy to use access control system. I started off with a Raspberry Pi and
                a PN532 NFC reader. I created a PHP app that communicated with a MySQL database to store a list of all students and staff along
                with their card ID. Staff could login to the web interface and grant students passage to another building, which would allow for
                one round trip, exiting the origin building, entering and then exiting the destination, as well as entering back to the origin.
                There was also a flagging system where administrators could flag an ID, the system would warn but not stop access being granted to those cards.
                Additionally, there was an emergency lockdown system, which would put the system into a staff only mode. Lastly, it had an emergency mode for when
                internet connectivity was not possible. Administrators could use special access cards to lock the system into always open or always closed modes.
                Over the course of this project I learned some of the core skills needed to be successful as a developer: error troubleshooting and perserverance.
                There were many points where I got stuck on a really confusing bug, but I was always able to overcome it. I also learned how to wire components
                together and the various communications methods such as I2C and SPI, among others. In addition, I learned how to solder components together for
                the first time. Looking back on this project, knowing what I know now, I wish I woul've used a different stack for the app. I have grown to love Python's
                web servers and frameworks for back end processing, and frontend frameworks like React. The app would be more stable and more easily usable by the end user.
                Regardless, this is still one of those things I always look back on and feel a sense of pride.

They also have some wolves that are kept there because they have some kind of condition that wouldn't allow them to survive in the wild. Over the course of this workshop, we learned about the pack strucutre, and behavioral patterns of wolves. We also learned about how to keep the wolves healthy via medications and other procedures. We even got to take part in a routine vaccination and administer the medicines to sedated wolves.</div>

I knew that RFID tags were being implanted in dogs with very similar anatomy to wolves. For this project, I explored some of the things that RFID chips could enable for a wildlife center. I explored the risks of the technology and what benefits you get. I created a prototype tagging system using an Arduino and RFID reader that stored serialized data in the board's onboard EEPROM memory. The system was made in a way it could be expanded, but it worked well as a proof of concept. It was also cost efficient. The board + reader and tags were only about $15 total.</div>

They were growing mushrooms that required an environment with very specific conditionas in order for the mushrooms to grow efficiently. These parameters were difficult to influence manually, so they saught a digitially controlled system. It needed to be cost effective in terms or resources to build the system, as well as in costs of electricity and internet badwidth. I started out with a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a temperature/humidity sensor, and a eCO2 sensor. I originally planned to use Python for the project, however my temperature sensor kept getting failed reads because Python wasn't fast enough on the limited hardware. I transitioned to using C++ as I was comfortable using it and wanted to improve on it. This project was where I gained a lot of useful knowledge in I2C communication for embedded devices. I ended up writing my own driver for one of the devices because there weren't any available that did what I wanted. The system which I named ClimatePi worked for sensing stuff and activating outputs when needed, but it never advanced to controlling real devices. Even if it was never used, I learned a lot not only about keeping climate in control, but working in C++ with devices over I2C.</div>

We visited old and historic sites that played a part in the development and success of the city. We visited sites such as the lock and damn and the mill city museum. We also explord the downtown area of Minneapolis, exploring the strucuture of streets, placement of buildings, and made use of the light rail system. We also visited the capitol area of St. Paul, exploring inside the capitol building as well as the areas surrounding it. We visited the site of the old Sears, and talked with an urban designer about potential plans for that building and the surrounding lot. One of my favorite parts was visiting the Hmong Town Marketplace, it was a very cool opportunity to see other cultures that are present in the Twin Cities, and hearing the story of the owner from where he grew up to how he got to America and founded the marketplace.</div>

I explored the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Removed/Recovered) model that is used to model an infectious epedemic. The basic idea is that you start with a certain number of susceptible and infected people. Certain (usually statuc) parameters detail the rate in which susceptible become infected, and infected become recovered or removed. In specific, this project tried to model what could happen if the ebola virus outbreak of 2014 ever became widespread in Minneapolis. It used historical data to determine the rough casualty rate and the overall loss of population. In terms of programming, this was one of my first experiences with many popular data scient libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I gained experiences in how to effectively organize and present your data, as well as the basics of working with arrays and dataframes. I also put a big emphasis on code organization, making sure to document all functions and follow the PEP-8 style guide, the most widely endorsed style guide for writing python code.</div>

                <div class="modal-body">This project was for one of our advisory's themed weeks. We had a week to create a project that fit the current theme.
                  In this case, the theme was Shrek. I knew I wanted to somehow involve machine learning into this project, and at the time the technology
                that had me captivated was LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks. These kinds of networks can "memorize" sequences, making them very good at NLP
                (Natural Language Processing) among other things. Now how would this relate to Shrek? Well my ultimate goal was to analyze the entire script of the movie,
                and use a LSTM network to identify all of the puns within the script. This was by far the most ambitious machine learning project I had taken on as of then.
                Like any good project, it started with a lot of research into the logic behind a LSTM network, as well as techniques of natural language processing. The main challenge
                one faces is converting words that humans understand, to numbers, which is what algorithms understand. The typical technique is to use embedding vectors and word tokenizing.
                This basically can convert words into tokens, and then uses what's called an "embedding vector" to put words in a three dimensional space, where words with similar meanings
                are close to one another. Once I had done that, came the challenge of converting that data into the proper format a LSTM network requires. To do this, I had to experiment
                a lot with the NumPy module to reshape the input arrays into a way that, when fed into my network, would produce an accurate result. I would say the bulk of my project was spent on
                preprocessing the data in the most efficient manner. Finally, there was tuning the network's structure and parameters. After that, all that was left was to build a simple user interface,
                which I did using a module called PySimpleGUI, it isn't going to win any awards for design, but it gets the job done. It actually eneded up training to a rather high accuracy, and was very effective in the end. I learned a lot of very useful things for this project, and it would lay the groundwork for some of my other projects which also involved LSTM networks. I also got more aquainted with data preprocessing and working with NumPy.</div>

                the networks to understand language, it was going to understand currency exchange. Specifically, predicting the trends of exchange rates for the future given past data. 
                At first, I was incredibly confused because the network was basically just making its predictions in a ramp shape. I spend weeks troubleshooting the issue, until I finally 
                isolated the issue to a data processing issue. I had been formating the data returned from the network in the wrong way. After I fixed that issue, the network was creating very realistic predictions. While it would likely not work for a real world use because it can't take into consideration the political drivers that determine those. It can only try looking at previous trends and producing
                something that looks similar to it. Overall, this was one of those projects that really broadened my knowledge on machine learning but also taught me how to
                debug machine learning algorithms, something I wasn't very effective with.</div>

                <div class="modal-body">This project was also the result of one of the themed weeks we had in our advisory. For this week, the theme was the wild west.
                  I was interested in exploring more advanced neural networks, so I picked neural attention. This is a model where the network can actually decide where
                  to "focus" on the input to produce its output. Specifically, I wanted the network to be able to generate captions for images from the wild west and civil war
                  areas of history. This project overall went well I think based on just the amount of learning I did. However, the actual outcome wasn't quite as impressive
                  because the captions were very weak and couldn't really capture what was happening in the image. The main reason I attribute to this is just a limited amount
                  of training data. It only had about 200 images, which is a small fraction of what you'd reasonably need to train something like this. Regardless, it was still
                  able to use nerual attention to generate captions. If I was able to get more data to feed it, I think it would've behaved much better.</div>

                  wasn't terribly interesting, it was creating a timeline of the Great Depression. However I was determined to learn some new technology or framework.
                  For this project, I wanted to learn Vue.js, a popular frontend JavaScript framework. This would be my first exposure to such a framework. I spent a couple weeks learning
                  Vue, which was a little difficult at first because all of these concepts were entirely new to me. However, I eventually grasped the concept and I got to work. For this project,
                  I wanted to concentrate as much as possilbe on clean, dynamic code. I wanted as little to be hardcoded as possible. In addition, I wanted the code to be easily readable. This project
                  also needed a backend API, and for that I chose the Python framework Flask. Much like the frontend, I wanted to focus on clean, organized code. My final outcome was an app I called
                  "Lineage", and it was a web app that lets you easily create timelines. Since this project was originally on the Great Depression, I used my new app to create a timeline of
                  the Greate Depression. Overall, I very much enjoyed this project as I got an introduction to modern web development, and how to deploy them to production.</div>

                <div class="modal-body">This was one of my lasts projects I would do at NWPHS, so I wanted to do something impressive. I decided I wanted to play
                  around with evolutionary learning. Specifically, I wanted to use NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topoligies), which is an algorithm that can
                  simulate the process of evolution and natural selection. I wanted to earn science credit for this project, so I decided it would be an interesting
                  and unique way to achieve those targets. Specifically, I wanted to use it to play the original Sonic the Hedgehog. Luckily, through the use of some
                  awesome open source projects such as the OpenAI Gym and their Gym Retro project, I had a very easy to use premade interface between algorithm and the game.
                  All that was left was to create the networks. Luckily, this was also fairly easy to do with a pre existing python module. For this project, most of the work
                  came in the form of calculating the fitness of a partical run. It was difficult to come up with a method of calculating how well any given example did. Eventually, I
                  was able to devise a method to give high scores high fitness, but also punish for genes that basically just "memorized" all the correct moves. While in the end, it could
                  barely make it through the first half of the level, I still was proud it was even able to get that far.</div>
